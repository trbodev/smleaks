          New devblog, coming through! This time, we want to focus on a few
          things that are coming up in the not-too-distant future and also show
          a few new things that are in the works for the next survival chapter.

          <br />
          Watch out! There are more bots incoming in the next chapter: While
          traveling deep underground, you might encounter the cablebots: they
          travel in big numbers and love digging holes with their cable
          clippers. No one knows why the cablebots are that deep in the first
          place yet; perhaps you will find the answer to this mystery in a
          future update. Until then, you had best prep some chests with potatoes
          and dust off that spudgun; you’re going to need it.

          <br />
          Progress on the new quest system for the next chapter is moving along.
          The quests in the chapter will guide you through the story while
          letting you continue playing at your own pace. We will also be adding
          a dialogue system to the game, letting NPCS talk to you! We love how
          it feels and where it&apos;s heading. Here is an image of the player
          taking an incoming call. it.

          <b>- Digital clock</b>
          <br />
          We have started work on a new interactive part. The next chapter will
          introduce a clock, so mechanics can check the time, anytime, whether
          they’re driving or at their base. But that’s not the best part about
          it: the clock will also allow the mechanic to set a specific time for
          it to interact with a trigger. Thanks to it, you should be able to set
          a time for your base defenses to turn on or off, so you can keep those
          uninvited nighttime visitors away! it.

          <br />
          In the Creative Mode update that’s just around the corner, we will be
          updating the terrain to include the same props as the world of
          Survival Mode. You will now be able to cut down trees and test out new
          ideas for lumber- or rock drilling-based creations. We also added
          water to some of the tiles, as well as a water border around the
          creative terrain world, so you can go on boat races with your friends!
          We also updated the flat world ground texture, since the old one was a
          bit out of date against the game&apos;s new visuals. We have also
          slightly increased the map size of both the terrain as well as flat
          world. You will have to create a new world to get the updated terrain
          however. The new props and water will not show up in old worlds.

          <b>- Decorate the main menu</b>
          <br />
          Some mechanics might have been wondering about that odd background
          platform that is sitting in the middle of the main menu. We’re finally
          putting it to its intended, original use: mechanics will now be able
          to enter that world so they can build and decorate their main menu,
          simply by clicking the blue pen icon at the bottom. Let&apos;s make
          some neat pixel art!

          <b>- Enemy capsules</b>
          <br />
          We’ve only given you sneak peeks at the enemy capsules for creative
          mode on our Twitter so here’s another good look at them in action. Use
          them to test your new traps and defenses against bots before your next
          survival mode session. But that’s not all; we’re also working on
          adding another feature to the enemy capsules: paint jobs. Now, you can
          paint bots in different colors, so they turn on each other instead.
          For example: if you spawn two tape bots and paint one yellow and the
          other pink, they’ll duke it out instead of coming after you! Lastly!
          Woc&apos;s and glowbugs will also get a capsule. The capsules will
          come with the new creative mode update.

          <br />
          Calling all new mechanics! Learning how to build a vehicle the first
          time you start the game can be a bit hard, especially when you’ve got
          nothing but the handbook. The new tutorial block is here to help you
          flatten that learning curve! Now, you can get step by step
          instructions on how to build a basic vehicle and grasp the game’s
          building fundamentals, simply by placing it on a lift. We are still
          not sure if this one will come out before or with the next chapter.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          That&apos;s all for now!
          <br />
          We have some truly cool stuff in the works that we will show in
          devblog 22, so please keep an eye out for it. It&apos;s something we
          know a lot of you mechanics will love.
