          <b>Greetings Mechanics!</b>
          <br />
          What’s that coming over the hill? Is it a devblog? Why yes, it most
          certainly is!
          <br />
          Some time has passed since our last post and the team here has been
          extremely busy clanking our collective hammers at some exciting new
          content. Our super-powered new game engine has allowed us to
          accelerate forward at max speed and we’re excited to share some of the
          results of that added torque in this update today!
          <br />
          <br />
          As usual, we’d like to kick off by again thanking you, the incredible
          Scrap Mechanic community, for your amazing support. We’re continuingly
          amazed to see your fantastic creations and can’t wait to see what
          comes next!
          <br />
          <br />
          Now, let’s take a look together at some exciting new stuff…

          <b>- Spud Guns!</b>
          <br />
          When things get heated in Survival Mode, Mechanics need reach no
          further than the brand new, fully-loaded Spud Gun!
          <br />
          In Survival Mode, your creations will always be the best form of
          defence against those pesky farmbots. However, when you’re on foot and
          your creations are out of reach, the Spud Gun (aka Potato Gun) is an
          exciting new tool at Mechanics’ disposal.
          <br />
          Furthermore, right know we’re testing a farming system (more on that
          later) where players will be able to harvest their own ammo! This
          opens up a lot of new and interesting gameplay that we’re sure you’ll
          find very a-peel-ing! We’re also playing with ways of attaching potato
          guns on your creations, for example on bearings. How s-mashing is
          that? (We’ll stop now).

          <b>- Massive Warehouses!</b>
          <br />
          If there’s a more exciting wording pair than, ‘massive warehouse’, us
          Mechanics sure don’t know about it! When we first started work on
          buildings for Survival Mode, our plan was to construct them out of
          building parts and to do our best to ensure that they were absolutely
          as huge as possible. During the process of creating these buildings we
          discovered that in order to make them as large as we originally
          imagined, it meant we wouldn’t be able to introduce them with
          destructible exteriors due to technical limitations.
          <br />
          Ultimately, this seemed like a fair compromise to achieve our main
          ambitions and we discovered that the decision actually enabled a lot
          of fun and tense gameplay! Inside these buildings, players no longer
          have the option of escaping through a hole in the wall when things go
          sour! To be clear, everything inside the warehouse can still be
          destroyed.
          <br />
          We absolutely intend to have fully destructible building exteriors in
          the game, but on a slightly smaller scale. In the meantime, we hope
          you enjoy the different gameplay these larger buildings introduce!

          <b>- The Sound of Survival!</b>
          <br />
          As many of you will know, here at Scrap Mechanic HQ we are currently
          very focussed on fleshing out and improving Survival Mode.
          <br />
          One of the things we really wanted to enhance was the mood when
          exploring the Survival world. This was obviously less of a priority
          when experimenting in Creative mode, but in Survival we really wanted
          the music to play a larger role in creating a deeper atmosphere for
          players.
          <br />
          Today we’re delighted to share a snippet of one of the Survival night
          tunes, which we hope will evoke a feeling of loneliness and isolation.
          Spooky!

          <b>- New Animation!</b>
          <br />
          With new features comes new animation!
          <br />
          Since the last devblog we’ve been quietly working on fresh animations
          to improve the quality of Survival Mode. Included in our list of
          revamps is the completely rebuilt crouch walk animation, a revamped
          hammer swing animation and an awesome new sprint, which you can see
          above. Much better than the old ‘fast walk’, right?
          <br />

          <br />
          As you can see, we also changed the standing pose to a slightly more
          heroic stance. Inspiring stuff, we’re sure you’ll agree!

          <b>- Crafting System!</b>
          <br />
          It took some time to get the Scrap Mechanic crafting system exactly
          how we wanted, but we’re delighted to announce that it’s finally in a
          place we’re really happy with! It was very important to us that our
          take on this mechnaic wasn’t just your regular loading bar crafting
          system. We wanted it to enable creativity where Mechanics could
          automate crafting chains and build their own crafting factories. We
          hope our Crafting System will be something a lot of you mechanics will
          really appreciate and use to light your creative spark. It’s only code
          right now, but we should have some visuals to show you by the time the
          next devblog rolls around. We’re very excited!

          <b>- Exo-Suit!</b>
          <br />
          Since the Mechanic is stranded on a farming planet, it makes sense
          that he’d wear an Exo-Suit, right? Well that’s what we were thinking,
          anyway, and so we went ahead and built a cool new outfit that will
          enable all kinds of fun improvements for player movement.
          <br />
          We won’t get into too much detail at the moment, since we’re still
          experimenting, but the general concept behind the Exo-Suit is to offer
          small perks such as a higher jump, increased armour or the ability to
          demolish scrap faster. What do you think? Let us know!
          <br />
          <br />
          And speaking of suits…

          What would a Scrap Mechanic devblog be without showing off a new set
          of threads for players to don?
          <br />
          As many of you know, alongside Survival Mode we will be adding outfits
          for the new character customization feature; Hats, gloves, shoes and
          shirts can all be mixed and matched separately! We are super stoked to
          get this in to your hands (and on to your bodies) when Survival comes
          out. We’ve also made a ton of cringey t-shirts, which is just how we
          like ‘em!

          <br />
          God’s beautiful creatures are about to invade the Survival world!
          <br />
          Take our word for it: It really does make the environment feel more
          alive when mischievous birds flutter around and interact with your
          creations. It’s perhaps not the most important feature in the game,
          but hopefully you’ll agree these new critters add a meaningful layer
          of detail to the world. And if you disagree, you can always smack them
          with your hammer… Though we don’t condone that.

          <b>- When is Survival coming out?</b>
          <br />
          When we released Scrap Mechanic we put the foundations in place. Now
          we’re busily crafting the gameplay systems and features that will
          hopefully make our game an even more satisfying and unique experience
          for fans.
          <br />
          Because we’re determined to hit those quality goals, nailing down an
          exact release date for Survival Mode feels premature right now, but
          rest assured that we’ll put it in your hands as soon as possible, once
          we’re satisfied that it’s up to our standards.
          <br />
          We know a lot of Mechanics don&#039;t like to wait, but we’re
          confident you’ll be pleased with the results when you finally get to
          experience them for yourselves. Hang in there! It will be worth the
          wait.
